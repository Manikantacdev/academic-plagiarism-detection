# AcademicGuard: Intelligent Academic Integrity Platform

AcademicGuard is a modern, full-stack academic integrity solution designed for educators and institutions. It combines advanced semantic plagiarism detection with state-of-the-art AI content analysis to ensure the originality of student submissions.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Multi-User Isolation**: Secure registration and login system. Every educator has their own private dashboard and reports history.
*   **Dual-Engine Detection**:
    *   **Plagiarism Engine**: Uses FAISS and Sentence-Transformers for high-speed semantic search across a shared knowledge base.
    *   **AI Detector**: Integrated RoBERTa-based models to identify text generated by ChatGPT, Gemini, and other LLMs.
*   **Shared Intelligence**: While user reports are private, all submissions contribute to a global knowledge base to catch cross-user plagiarism.
*   **Interactive Reports**: Side-by-side comparison of submissions with matched sources, highlighting exact and paraphrased matches.
*   **Comprehensive Analytics**: Visual trends for average originality, risk distribution, and submission metrics.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy
*   **Password Safety**: All user passwords are encrypted using `bcrypt` (72-char truncation enforced).
*   **Data Isolation**: Submissions are linked to specific User IDs. No user can view another user's report history.
*   **CORS Protection**: Configured to restrict API access to the approved frontend origin.
